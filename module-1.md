## Elements of Information Security
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Authenticity
- Non-Repudiability

## Motives, Goal, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks

Attack = motive (goal) + method + vulnerability

## Classification of attacks

1. Passive attacks
    - do not tamper
    - involves intercepting
    - monitoring network traffic
    - eg: sniffing, evesdropping
2. Active attacks
