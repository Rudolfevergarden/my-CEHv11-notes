## Elements of Information Security
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Authenticity
- Non-Repudiability

## Motives, Goal, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks

Attack = motive (goal) + method + vulnerability

## Classification of attacks

1. Passive attacks
    - do not tamper
    - involves intercepting
    - monitoring network traffic
    - eg: sniffing, evesdropping
2. Active attacks
    - Tamper with data
    - disrupt the communication
    - bypass or break in
    - eg: DoS, man in the middle, session hijacking, SQL Injection
3. Close in Attacks
    - In close physical proximity
    - gather, modify or distrupt access
    - eg: eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving
4. Insider Attack
    - intentionally cause a threat to the organization.
    - eg: keyloggers, backdoors.
5. Distributed attacks
    - tamper with hardware or software prior to installation

## Information Warfare
The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for competitive advantages over an opponent.

Example of information warefare weapons
- viruses
- worms
- Torjan horses
- logic bomb
- traps doors etc.

Categories (by Martin Libicki)
- **Command and control warfare**(c2 warfare)
The Impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or the network they control.
- **Intellogence based warfare**
Sensor based technology that directly corrupts technological systems.
- **Electronic warfare**
Use of radio electoronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication.
- **Psychological warfare**
Techniques such as propaganda and terror to demoralize one's opponent in an attempt to succeed in battle.
- **Hacker warfare**
Can vary from the shutdown of systems, data error, theft of information, theft of service, false messaging, system monitering, access to data, logic bomb, virus etc.
- **Economic warfare**




## Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
- Component of intellegence driven defence for identification and prevention of malicious intrusion activities.
- Helps understand the adversary's tactics, teacniques, and procedures.

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
- pattern of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or group of threat actors.

### Tactics
- way an attacker performs the attack.
